# MM-Hub — Progress Tracker

## Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETE)
- [x] Next.js scaffold with App Router
- [x] Supabase auth (Microsoft SSO + email/password)
- [x] Two-tier access model (hub_users + module_access)
- [x] Database schema: growers, remittances, QA, documents, FreshTrack ft_* tables, sync_logs
- [x] RLS policies for all tables
- [x] Grower portal shell (dashboard, sales, remittances, documents, QA, forecasting, settings, admin pages)
- [x] Hub admin shell (users, modules)

## Phase 2: Sync Engine (COMPLETE)

### FreshTrack Sync
- [x] `sync_config` table — admin-configurable field mappings per sync step (migration 00002)
- [x] Default FreshTrack mappings seeded (8 steps: entities → products → consignments → orders → pallets → dispatch → charges → stock)
- [x] `lib/freshtrack.ts` — pg Pool connection to FreshTrack RDS (read-only, max 3 connections, SSL)
- [x] `lib/sync-utils.ts` — shared utilities (extractWeightKg, deriveProduceCategory, chunkArray, mapSourceRow, applyTransforms)
- [x] `app/api/cron/sync-freshtrack/route.ts` — Vercel Cron handler (every 15 min, CRON_SECRET auth, config-driven sync loop, batch upsert, sync logging)

### NetSuite Sync
- [x] `lib/netsuite.ts` — NetSuite REST API client (OAuth 1.0 TBA via HMAC-SHA256, pagination, rate limit retry)
- [x] `sync_config` seeded for NetSuite RCTI sync (migration 00003)
- [x] `app/api/cron/sync-netsuite/route.ts` — Vercel Cron handler (every 30 min, incremental sync, RCTI → remittances + line items + charges)
- [ ] RCTI PDF retrieval (deferred — requires NetSuite file cabinet access or PDF generation endpoint)

### Infrastructure
- [x] `vercel.json` — cron definitions for both FreshTrack (*/15) and NetSuite (*/30)
- [x] `sync_logs` recording on every cron run (status, records_synced, error_message, timestamps)
- [x] `CRON_SECRET` validation on all cron routes (skipped in development)

### Architecture Decisions
- **sync_config table:** Field mappings are database-driven and admin-configurable, not hardcoded. 8 FreshTrack steps + 1 NetSuite step seeded with best-guess column names. When actual column names are discovered, an admin updates mappings in the browser — no code deploy needed.
- **NetSuite OAuth:** Uses `oauth-1.0a` with HMAC-SHA256 Token-Based Authentication. RCTI record type (`vendorBill`) is a configurable constant in `lib/netsuite.ts`.
- **Sync error isolation:** Each step/record is wrapped in try/catch — one failure doesn't block others. Step-level errors are collected and reported in sync_logs.
- **Grower resolution:** Uses `growers.freshtrack_code` to map FreshTrack `entity_code` to portal `grower_id` (same mapping for both FreshTrack and NetSuite sync).
- **Transform rules:** Support `extract_from_product_name`, `calculate_from_quantity_and_product`, and `derive_from_product` transforms.
- **NetSuite line items:** Use delete+reinsert pattern (leveraging ON DELETE CASCADE on remittance_line_items/charges FK).
- **Rate limiting:** NetSuite client has exponential backoff on HTTP 429, max 3 retries.

### Known Issues
- All FreshTrack field mappings are best guesses — need introspection against actual `v_power_bi_*` views by running `SELECT * FROM v_power_bi_xxx LIMIT 1` against the real database.
- NetSuite RCTI record type (`vendorBill` vs `vendorCredit` vs custom) and field names need verification with the Mackays finance team and a sandbox API call.
- `oauth-1.0a` package installed for NetSuite TBA (not a widely maintained package — monitor for security updates).

## Phase 6: Polish, Mobile & Deployment (COMPLETE)

### Subdomain Architecture (COMPLETE)
- [x] `lib/subdomain.ts` — portal mode detection (`grower` | `hub` | `dev`) from hostname, with env var override support (`NEXT_PUBLIC_GROWER_DOMAIN`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_HUB_DOMAIN`)
- [x] `middleware.ts` — detects portal mode, sets `x-portal-mode` header, blocks `/hub-admin/*` in grower mode
- [x] Login page — three subdomain-aware layouts:
  - **Grower** (`grower.mackaysmarketing.com.au`): "Grower Portal" header, email/password only, no SSO
  - **Hub** (`hub.mackaysmarketing.com.au`): "MM-Hub" header, Microsoft SSO only, no email form
  - **Dev** (`localhost`): both auth methods (existing dual layout)
- [x] Root page (`app/page.tsx`) — grower mode always redirects to `/dashboard`, hub/dev follows multi-module routing
- [x] Auth callback (`app/(auth)/callback/route.ts`) — redirects to `/dashboard` in grower mode, `/` in hub/dev
- [x] Grower portal layout — suppresses module switcher in grower mode, shows "Grower Portal" in sidebar header

- [x] `components/top-bar.tsx` — accepts sidebarTrigger and badge slots
- [x] `components/portal-shell.tsx` — client wrapper managing sidebar state + freshness badge + farm selector, exports `usePortalData()` context hook
- [x] `app/(grower-portal)/layout.tsx` — uses `PortalShell` for mobile-aware layout, passes farm/financial context

### Data Freshness (COMPLETE)

## Phase 7: Grower Groups & Access Control Restructure (COMPLETE)

### Data Model Change
- OLD: `growers` (businesses) → `farms` (sub-units, synced from FreshTrack) — WRONG assumption
- NEW: `grower_groups` (parent businesses, Mackays-side only) → `growers` (individual farms/FreshTrack entities)
- Each row in `growers` IS a farm (one FreshTrack entity = one farm)
- `grower_groups` is a Mackays admin concept — hub admin creates groups and assigns growers to them
- `farms` table, `farm_id` columns, `get_portal_farm_ids()` — all REMOVED

### Database (migration 00004 — rewritten)
- [x] `grower_groups` table — parent business grouping (name, code, abn, contact info, address)
- [x] `grower_group_id` column added to `growers` table (FK to grower_groups)
- [x] RLS policies: hub admin manages all, portal staff reads all, grower reads own group, service role full access
- [x] `get_portal_grower_group_id()` helper — returns user's grower_group_id from module_access config
- [x] `get_portal_grower_ids()` helper — returns accessible grower UUIDs (null = all in group)
- [x] Grower group member RLS: users see growers in their group (grower_admin sees all, grower user filtered by grower_ids config)
- [x] Grower admin RLS for module_access — can read users in same grower_group

### Access Control Model
- [x] `GrowerPortalConfig`: `grower_group_id` (which group), `grower_ids` (null = all, array = specific), `financial_access`, `capabilities`
- [x] `GrowerPortalContext`: `growerGroupId`, `growerIds`, `financialAccess`, `moduleRole`, `capabilities`, `menuItems`
- [x] `lib/portal-access.ts` — `getPortalAccessContext()` + `getGrowerFilter()` shared helpers for API routes
- [x] `lib/financial-filter.ts` — `stripFinancials()` recursively nulls monetary fields

### Grower Context & Switcher
- [x] `hooks/use-grower-context.ts` — fetches accessible growers (filtered by grower_group_id + grower_ids), manages selectedGrowerId state
- [x] `components/grower-switcher.tsx` — dropdown with "All growers" + individual grower names with region/code
- [x] `components/portal-shell.tsx` — provides `PortalDataContext` (selectedGrowerId, financialAccess) via React context

### API Grower Filtering & Financial Access
- [x] `/api/dashboard/stats`, `/volume`, `/customer-mix` — grower_id filter via getGrowerFilter()
- [x] `/api/sales/weekly-breakdown`, `/price-landscape` — grower_id filter, financial access stripping
- [x] `/api/remittances` — financial access stripping (grower-level)

### Grower Admin User Management
- [x] `app/api/grower-portal/admin/users/route.ts` — scoped by grower_group_id (was grower_id), grower_ids validation
- [x] `app/api/grower-portal/admin/growers/route.ts` — lists growers in admin's grower_group (replaced farms route)
- [x] `app/(grower-portal)/settings/users/page.tsx` — grower checkboxes (was farm checkboxes), menu items, financial toggles

### Hub Admin Updates
- [x] `app/api/hub-admin/grower-groups/route.ts` — NEW: GET list all, POST create grower_group
- [x] `app/api/hub-admin/growers/route.ts` — updated: returns grower_group_id
- [x] Module assignment POST defaults: `grower_ids: null`, `financial_access` auto-populated per role
- [x] User edit page: "Grower Group" dropdown (was "Grower"), grower checkboxes for grower role, info text for grower_admin

### Seed Data
- [x] 2 sample grower_groups (North Queensland Banana Co, Tropical Fruit Partners)
- [x] 5 sample growers assigned to groups (was farms)

### Architecture Decisions
- **Grower groups:** Hub admin creates grower_groups (parent businesses) and assigns growers (FreshTrack entities) to them. grower_groups table is Mackays-side only — not synced from FreshTrack. Each grower (farm) can belong to one grower_group.
- **Grower-level access:** A user's `grower_ids` in module_access config controls which growers they see within their group. null = all growers in group (admin/staff/grower_admin default). Array = specific growers only.
- **Financial access:** Per-menu-item boolean in `financial_access` config. When false, API routes strip monetary fields from responses (replaced with null, not 0).
- **Grower admin role:** `grower_admin` manages users within their grower group from /settings/users. Has `manage_grower_users` and `view_all_growers` capabilities.
- **Grower switcher:** Appears in portal shell top bar when user has 2+ accessible growers. "All growers" = consolidated view.

### File Structure
